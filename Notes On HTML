In every HTML file you need tags, which are these symbles: "<" and ">"
To close a tag you must put a "/" infront of the second tag: "</"
To start off every HTML document you must have <!DOCTYPE html> which declares that it is HTML
Then you must have a structure to your code by adding <html> and </html> and everything goes in between them
"<head>" is a tag that contains metadata, metadata is info that isn't shown in plain site but is still very active in the code
If you want to create a title you would use <title>
The title appears at the top of the webpage for the site title
Now you must add a body to the code by writing <body>
Once a code has a body, it can have text and images and all sorts of cool stuff
<p> is the command to start a paragraph or any piece of text that you would like
If you want to paragraph to be seperated into many different lines you must add a break
A break is done by the command "<br />"
Spacing is also very important for HTML as it is easier to read and helps the program fun efficiently
