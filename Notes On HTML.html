	<body>
	 <ul> 
	    <li>In every HTML file you need tags, which are these symbles: "<" and ">".
		    To close a tag you must put a "/" infront of the second tag: "< />"
	    <li>To start off every HTML document you must have < !DOCTYPE  html> which declares that it is HTML.
			Then you must have a structure to your code by adding "< html>"  and "</ html>" and everything goes in between them.
			"< head>" is a tag that contains metadata, metadata is info that isn't shown in plain site but is still very active in the code.
	    <li>If you want to create a title you would use "< title>", the title appears at the top of the webpage for the site title.
	 </ul>
	 <h1> Lists </h1>
	 <ul> 
		<li> To create a list, you must start with a "< ul>" tag and finish with a "< /ul>" 
	    <li> For every item you want to name, you must put the tag "< li>"
		<p> Here is an example of the coding required to make an <strong> UNORDERED </strong> list:</p>
		<p> <code> &ltul> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &ltli> This is the first item on my list </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &ltli> This is the second item on my list </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &lt/ul> </code> </p>
		
		<p> Here is an example of the coding required to make an <strong> ORDERED / NUMERICAL </strong> list: </p>
		<p> <code> &ltol> </code> </p>
		<p>	<code> &ltli> This is the first item on my list </code> </p>
		<p>	<code> &ltli> This is the second item on my list </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &lt&#47ol&gt </code> </p>
	 </ul>
	 <h1> Images </h1>
	  <ul>
		<li> To add an image, you must have the tag "< img src=..../>" </li>
		<li> The "src" element specifies the URL or Web Address	of the image
		<li> The "alt" attribute puts in a text incase the user cannot view it
		<li> An example of putting in an image is like this:
		<p> <code> &lt!DOCTYPEhtml> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &lthtml </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &ltbody> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &ltimg src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/1102/images/story_full_width/Gorillas_7.31.2012_Our_closest_cousins_HI_105193.jpg?1345537507"> </code> <code> alt=Gorilla </code> <code> style="width:304px;height:228px;"> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &lt&#47body&gt </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &lt&#47html&gt </code> </p>
		<li> This code will make the image appear like this:
		<img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/1102/images/story_full_width/Gorillas_7.31.2012_Our_closest_cousins_HI_105193.jpg?1345537507" alt=Gorilla style="width:175px;height:75px;">
	  </ul>
	 <h1> Videos </h1>
	  <ul>
	    <li> In HTML, there are 3 supported video formats:
	  <ol> 
		<li> MP4
		<li> WebM
		<li> Ogg
	  </ol>
		<li> For a basic video input, you must put the tag <code> &ltvideo> </code>
		<li> Videos can be attached to HTML Websites like this:
		<p> <code> &ltvideo </code> <code> width="320" </code> <code> length="240" </code> <code> controls> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &ltsource src="movie.mp4" </code> <code> type="video/mp4"> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &ltsource src="movie.ogg" </code> <code> type="video/ogg"> </code> </p>
		<p> <code> Your browser does not support the video tag </code> </p>
		<p> <code> &lt&#47video&gt </code> </p>

In every HTML file you need tags, which are these symbles: "<" and ">"
To close a tag you must put a "/" infront of the second tag: "</"
To start off every HTML document you must have <!DOCTYPE html> which declares that it is HTML
Then you must have a structure to your code by adding <html> and </html> and everything goes in between them
"<head>" is a tag that contains metadata, metadata is info that isn't shown in plain site but is still very active in the code
If you want to create a title you would use <title>
The title appears at the top of the webpage for the site title
Now you must add a body to the code by writing <body>
Once a code has a body, it can have text and images and all sorts of cool stuff
<p> is the command to start a paragraph or any piece of text that you would like
If you want to paragraph to be seperated into many different lines you must add a break
A break is done by the command "<br />"
Spacing is also very important for HTML as it is easier to read and helps the program run efficiently 
White Space makes the code more readable and puts each element of code on its own line
Indentation is another way to make the code easier to read
HTML files allow you to create comments to help explain your code and your ideas
Comments begin with "<!--" and end with "-->"
"<div>" can contain any text or other HTML elements. They are primarily used to divide HTML documents into section
"<span>" contain short pieces of text orother HTML. They are primarily used to wrap small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content and do not break text into different sections.
The "<em>" tag will generally become an ITALIC emphasis
The "<strong>" tag will generally become a BOLD emphasis
You can break a line of code by using "<br>" which creates a new line for your code. You do not need to add an ending tag for this.
The "<ul>" tag is meant for creating lists and cannot hold raw text.
If you want to list items you'd use "<li>", it is used to describe an item in the list. You do not have to end this
To create an ordered list (numerical), you will use the tag "<ol>" to start the list then for each item add "<li>" and ENDING the tag with "</li>"
To add an image you must add the tag "<img>" 
Whenever you add an image, it must be followed by "src"
EXAMPLE:
<img src=......../>
