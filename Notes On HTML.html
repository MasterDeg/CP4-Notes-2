In every HTML file you need tags, which are these symbles: "<" and ">"
To close a tag you must put a "/" infront of the second tag: "</"
To start off every HTML document you must have <!DOCTYPE html> which declares that it is HTML
Then you must have a structure to your code by adding <html> and </html> and everything goes in between them
"<head>" is a tag that contains metadata, metadata is info that isn't shown in plain site but is still very active in the code
If you want to create a title you would use <title>
The title appears at the top of the webpage for the site title
Now you must add a body to the code by writing <body>
Once a code has a body, it can have text and images and all sorts of cool stuff
<p> is the command to start a paragraph or any piece of text that you would like
If you want to paragraph to be seperated into many different lines you must add a break
A break is done by the command "<br />"
Spacing is also very important for HTML as it is easier to read and helps the program run efficiently 
White Space makes the code more readable and puts each element of code on its own line
Indentation is another way to make the code easier to read
HTML files allow you to create comments to help explain your code and your ideas
Comments begin with "<!--" and end with "-->"
